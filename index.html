            <h2>Welcome to the MLNCP Workshop at NeurIPS 2024!</h2>
            <p>The workshop will take place on the <b>14th or 15th December at NeurIPS 2024 in Vancouver, Canada</b>. The exact date and location will be announced soon.</p>

            <p>Digital computing is approaching fundamental limits and faces serious challenges in terms of scalability, performance, and sustainability. At the same time, generative AI is fuelling an explosion in compute demand. There is, thus, a growing need to explore non-traditional computing paradigms, such as (opto-)analog, neuromorphic hardware, and physical systems. Expanding on last year's successful NeurIPS workshop, which was the first of its kind in this community, we aim to bring together researchers from machine learning and alternative computation fields to establish new synergies between ML models and non-traditional hardware. Co-designing models with specialized hardware, a feature that has also been key to the synergy of digital chips like GPUs and deep learning, has the potential to offer a step change in the efficiency and sustainability of machine learning at scale. Beyond speeding up standard deep learning, new hardware may open the door for efficient inference and training of model classes that have been limited by compute resources, such as energy-based models and deep equilibrium models. So far, however, these hardware technologies have fallen short due to inherent noise, device mismatch, a limited set of compute operations, and reduced bit-depth. As a community, we need to develop new models and algorithms that can embrace and, in fact, exploit these characteristics. This workshop aims to encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration to exploit the opportunities offered by emerging AI accelerators both at training and at inference.</p>

            <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Advances in machine-learning that benefit from compute paradigms beyond standard digital compute, for example analog, photonic, in-memory, neuromorphic, or quantum compute.</li>
                <li>Advances in machine learning methods that can handle challenges such as low bit precision, variability or noise induced by new hardware. Examples include inherently noise-robust models, algorithms to reduce errors in ML arithmetic, or ways to share and distribute models across unique analog hardware.</li>
                <li>Advances in machine-learning paradigms that facilitate training and/or inference on new hardware paradigms. This can be general or specific to, for example, generative models for modalities such as image or sequence data.</li>
                <li>Surveys and position papers for machine-learning with new compute paradigms.</li>
