      <h2>Welcome to the MLNCP Workshop at NeurIPS 2023!</h2>
      <p>This workshop aims to bring together ML researchers with academic and industrial researchers building novel AI accelerators.
          The goal is to enable interaction between the two groups and kick-start a new feedback cycle between models and accelerators and to enable hardware-model co-design. 
          We welcome relevant algorithmic or model-innovations as well as results demonstrated on accelerators in the following categories: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>photonic or optical compute</li>
        <li>neuromorphic compute</li>
        <li>in-memory compute</li>
        <li>low-precision and edge-compute</li>
        <li>analog compute</li>
        <li>biologically-plausible machine-learning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The workshop will be held on <b>December 16th, 2023</b> as part of the NeurIPS conference in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>As GPU computing comes closer to a plateau in terms of efficiency and cost due
        to Moore' s law reaching its limit, there is a growing need to explore alternative
        computing paradigms, such as (opto-)analog, neuromorphic, and low-power computing. This NeurIPS workshop aims to unite researchers from machine learning
        and alternative computation fields to establish a new hardware-ML feedback loop.
        By co-designing models with specialized accelerators, we can leverage the benefits
        of increased throughput or lower per-flop power consumption. Novel devices hold
        the potential to further accelerate standard deep learning or even enable efficient inference and training of hitherto compute-constrained model classes. However, new
        compute paradigms typically present challenges such as intrinsic noise, restricted
        sets of compute operations, or limited bit-depth, and thus require model-hardware
        co-design. This workshop's goal is to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration to
        capitalize on the opportunities offered by emerging AI accelerators.</p>

        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>
            The 2023 Workshop on ML with New Compute Paradigms is calling for
             papers on machine-learning models and algorithms that enable training 
             or inference on novel AI accelerators. Potential areas of interest include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Performance analysis of algorithms and models on future or current hardware.</li>
            <li>New or existing model paradigms (e.g. spiking networks or other neuromorphic models, energy-based models, or others) that map well onto AI accelerators currently in development.</li>
            <li>Strategies for inference or training on such new hardware. This includes new training algorithms or approaches to enable inference of pretrained models.</li>
            <li>Strategies for dealing with precision issues and hardware-induced noise in analog machine learning.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> <b> Best paper award:</b> The best paper will be recognized!</p>
        <p>
            Submissions that discuss work-in-progress, unanswered questions, and challenges for new AI accelerator hardware are also welcome.
        </p>
        <b>Guidelines for submission</b>

        <ul>
            <li>Please submit without author information (anonymous authors), as review at NeurIPS is double blind. </li>
            <li>Submissions should be no more than 6 pages long, excluding references and supplementary material. Supplementary materials should only be used for details; the paper should be self-contained.</li>
            <li>Please use the workshop template: <a href="./mlncp_2023.sty">mlncp_2023.sty</a> </li>
        </ul>

    <b>Important note:</b>
    <p>Authors do not forfeit the right to publish elsewhere.</p>
    <p>All accepted works will be made available on the workshop website.
       However, authors retain full copyright of their work and are free to publish their
       extended work in another journal or conference. We allow submission of works that
       overlap with papers that are under review or have been recently published in a
       conference or a journal, including science journals. Cross-submissions to multiple workshops at NeurIPS 
       are not accepted.</p>
