      <h2>Welcome to the MLNCP NeurIPS Workshop 2023!</h2>
      <p>This workshop aims to bring together ML researchers with academic and industrial researchers building novel AI accelerators.
          The goal is to enable interaction between the two groups and kick-start a new feedback cycle between models and accelerators and to enable hardware-model co-design. 
          We welcome relevant algorithmic or model-innovations as well as results demonstrated on accelerators in the following categories: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>photonic or optical compute</li>
        <li>neuromorphic compute</li>
        <li>in-memory compute</li>
        <li>low-precision and edge-compute</li>
        <li>analog compute</li>
        <li>biologically-plausible machine-learning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The workshop will be held on December 15th or 16th, 2023 as part of the NeurIPS conference in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>As GPU computing comes closer to a plateau in terms of efficiency and cost due
        to Moore' s law reaching its limit, there is a growing need to explore alternative
        computing paradigms, such as (opto-)analog, neuromorphic, and low-power computing. This NeurIPS workshop aims to unite researchers from machine learning
        and alternative computation fields to establish a new hardware-ML feedback loop.
        By co-designing models with specialized accelerators, we can leverage the benefits
        of increased throughput or lower per-flop power consumption. Novel devices hold
        the potential to further accelerate standard deep learning or even enable efficient inference and training of hitherto compute-constrained model classes. However, new
        compute paradigms typically present challenges such as intrinsic noise, restricted
        sets of compute operations, or limited bit-depth, and thus require model-hardware
        co-design. This workshop's goal is to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration to
        capitalize on the opportunities offered by emerging AI accelerators.</p>
