# ML with New Compute Paradigms NeurIPS Workshop 2024
This workshop aims to bring together ML researchers with academic and industrial researchers building novel AI accelerators.
The goal is to enable interaction between the two groups and kick-start a new feedback cycle between models and accelerators and to enable hardware-model co-design. 
We welcome relevant algorithmic or model-innovations as well as results demonstrated on accelerators in the following categories:
1. photonic or optical compute
2. neuromorphic compute
3. in-memory compute
4. low-precision and edge-compute
5. analog compute
6. biologically-plausible machine-learning
